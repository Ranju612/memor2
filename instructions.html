<h1>How to Play </h1>
<p>Welcome to the Mystic Maze instructions! This guide will help you master the game and enjoy every level. The goal of Mystic Maze is to guide the yellow coin through a maze of moving blocks and reach the green exit safely. Each level lasts two minutes, and sliding blocks shift every five seconds, adding an exciting challenge.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the on-screen mobile controls to move the coin. You can push the dark gray sliding blocks horizontally or vertically to clear a path. Plan your moves carefully, because blocks may shift unexpectedly, requiring quick thinking and strategy.

Keep an eye on the timer displayed at the top of the game screen. Completing levels faster earns you higher points, which are recorded on the leaderboard so you can compete with other players.

Follow these simple steps to maximize your fun:

1. Start at the yellow coin’s position.

2. Observe the maze and plan your route.

3. Push sliding blocks to clear obstacles.

4. Reach the green exit before time runs out.

5. Advance to higher levels and earn points!

Mystic Maze combines entertainment with brain training, making it perfect for players of all ages. Follow these instructions carefully and improve your memory while having a fun and immersive gaming experience!</p>
